<p> Anthony <em>"Tony"</em> Soprano is the boss of the DiMeo crime family, North Jersey's most powerful criminal organization. He lives in North Caldwell, NJ. Tony <strong>never had the makings of a Varsity athlete</strong>, small hands, that was his problem. This is what eventually lead to his downfall, along with the lack of roasted turkey in his fridge. <p>

<h4> Some of my favorite scenes of Tony Soprano </h4>

<p> Phillip <em>"Phil"</em> Leotardo is a captain of the more powerful New York City Lupertazzi crime family. Phil dislikes ice cream and is a reckless driver. Only the most seasoned and intelligable Sopranos fans, with extensive research, know that Phil did <strong> 20 years in the can. </strong>
<h4> Some of my favorite Leotardo clips </h4>
<p> Phil gets in a car accident because of his dislike of icecream. Tankfully, Tony is driving behind him and helps Phil. </p>

<p> It is hard to tell how many years Phil did in the can. <em> (Stop watching after 40 seconds unless you wish to spoil this great show)</em> </p>
